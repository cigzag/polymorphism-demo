# polymorphism-demo
A demo repository which displays polymorphism in C++

The example in main.cpp has a example of function overloading
I was thinking about utilizing operator overloading but I feel that might not be the best route to go for a simple demonstration piece.

**This example uses the standard library.**

End result of example demo
